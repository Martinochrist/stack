1. create a linked list based stack
push five values to the stack then pop three out
 of the stack finally peek the stack.

2. write a program(using a stack) that accepts
 user inputs which are sentences then when 
 the user enters z it brings up all the previous 
 sentences watch the example output carefully:

>>> enter a word , sentence or phrase
x is a letter
14 is a number
cars are machines
z

>> cars are machines
>> 14 is a number
>> x is a letter
a house
z 
>> a house
>> cars are machines
>> 14 is a number
>> x is a letter

3. create two programs that solves two problems of 
your choice using a stack and a linked list


step one 
1.create a stack of empty list
2. write an algorithm that ecept user input 
3. write an algorithm that can can break out the las
